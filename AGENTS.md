# PCT Starter App

A **starter app** for people learning to code with AI assistance. It's a minimal skeleton with basic features (including AI) so you can build on top of it.

## Goal

Keep the codebase clean and predictable so AI assistants can help add features without things getting messy. The structure guides where new code should go.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** + **ShadCN** for UI
- **OpenAI** (Responses API) for AI features

See the Cursor rules for detailed structure and conventions.
